### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [Converting Colors](https://convertingcolors.com/) - Particullarly I like to call the colors on my CSS code by its HEX code (not always the best choice though). This website converts the code for you from any format you have to any format you like. By now, it is my favorite.
